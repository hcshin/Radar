Codes for simulating phase-coded compound barker code transmitter and receiver.
Includes...
1. code for exhaustive compound barker code generator with length range and PSLR (Peak-to-SideLobe Ratio) level.
2. code for PCR (Pulse Compression Ratio) calculation.
3. code for transmitter side (uses USRP)
4. code for receiver side (uses USRP). It brute-forces all codes in the code set to find the transmitted code.
